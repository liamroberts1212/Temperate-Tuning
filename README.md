# Temperate-Tuning

### Application Overview
Application capable of generating soundscapes of a user-specified location, de-tuning instrumental samples as if they were being played in the specified location.

### How to use
1. Run `python ./project.py'
2. Enter location (name or zip code, as long as the Google weather API tracks it you can request it)
3. Press any letter on the keyboard to play a sample, '\' to toggle between sample sets
4. Enjoy (:

### TODO:
The entire project. This was a 2am deep listening job, plain and simple. Actually structure files and samples + think a little.
